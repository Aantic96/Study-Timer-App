Study Timer App was created due to my personal need for tracking time spent studying, but feel free to use if you stumble upon it.

The images for buttons were generated via ChatGPT.

Here is the example of what the application looks like:

Buttons below shown time are as they follow: Play, Pause and Restart.

Button export logs the date of your export and the time spent studying in the StudyLog.xlsx file. There is also a cell calculating the complete time spent on your studies for the given month. 
You DO NOT need to create the mentioned file - the app does it for you upon your first export.

The app provides some basic tests which delete the test file upon completion.
